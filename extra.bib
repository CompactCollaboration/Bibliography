This sample is derived from the new CatWISE2020 catalog, which contains deep photometric measurements at 3.4 and 4.6 μm from the cryogenic, post-cryogenic, and reactivation phases of the WISE mission. While the direction of the dipole in the quasar sky is similar to that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), its amplitude is over twice as large as expected, rejecting the canonical, exclusively kinematic interpretation of the CMB dipole with a p-value of 5 × 10−7 (4.9σ for a normal distribution, one-sided), the highest significance achieved to date in such studies. Our results are in conflict with the cosmological principle, a foundational assumption of the concordance ΛCDM model.},

The addition of new data in the CF4 has resulted in an increase in the estimate of the bulk flow in a sphere of radius 150 h−1 Mpc relative to the CosmicFlows-3 (CF3). This bulk flow has an \\$\\sim 0.015~\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ chance of occurring in the standard cosmological model with cosmic microwave background derived parameters. Given that the CF4 is deeper than the CF3, we were able to use the CF4 to accurately estimate the bulk flow on scales of 200 h−1 Mpc (equivalent to 266 Mpc for Hubble constant H0 = 75 km s−1 Mpc−1) for the first time. This bulk flow is in even greater tension with the standard model, having \\$\\sim 1.5\\times 10^\\{-4\\}\\ \\\\%\\$ probability of occurring. To estimate the bulk flow accurately, we introduce a novel method to calculate distances and velocities from distance moduli that is unbiased and accurate at all distances.

This is possible because the polarization angles of the CMB are rotated by both the cosmic birefringence and miscalibration effects, whereas those of the Galactic foreground emission are rotated only by the latter. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the \\$E\\$- and \\$B\\$-mode power spectra of the foreground emission, but uses only the knowledge of the CMB polarization spectra. Specifically, we relate the observed \\$EB\\$ correlation to the difference between the observed\\$E\\$- and \\$B\\$-mode spectra in the sky, and use different multipole dependences of the CMB (given by theory) and foreground spectra (given by data) to derive the likelihood for the miscalibration angle \\$\\alpha\\$ and the birefringence angle \\$\\beta\\$.

Mentoring relationships provide developmental spaces in which students' STEMM skills are honed and pathways into STEMM fields can be discovered. Because mentorship can be so influential in shaping the future STEMM workforce, its occurrence should not be left to chance or idiosyncratic implementation. There is a gap between what we know about effective mentoring and how it is practiced in higher education.\nThe Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM studies mentoring programs and practices at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It explores the importance of mentorship, the science of mentoring relationships, mentorship of underrepresented students in STEMM, mentorship structures and behaviors, and institutional cultures that support mentorship. This report and its complementary interactive guide present insights on effective programs and practices that can be adopted and adapted by institutions, departments, and individual faculty members.},
